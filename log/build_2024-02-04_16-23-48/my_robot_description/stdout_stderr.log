[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmy_py_pkg.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "my_py_pkg", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "my_py_pkg" with
  any of the following names:

    my_py_pkgConfig.cmake
    my_py_pkg-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "my_py_pkg" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "my_py_pkg_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "my_py_pkg" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
